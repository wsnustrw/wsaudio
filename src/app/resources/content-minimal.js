            <p>I’m a <InlineCode>Vienna-based</InlineCode> design engineer with a passion for solving complex problems through simple, elegant design solutions. With a strong foundation in both design and technology, I strive to create seamless and meaningful experiences that resonate with users and drive business outcomes.</p>
            <p>My work spans a diverse range of disciplines, from crafting <Link href="/work">intuitive digital interfaces</Link> to designing immersive interactive experiences. I’m particularly interested in the intersection of design and engineering, where aesthetics meet functionality. I believe that the best solutions arise from a balance of creativity and technical rigor, and I enjoy the challenge of finding that balance in every project I undertake.</p>
            <p>Throughout my career, I’ve had the opportunity to collaborate with cross-functional teams, bringing together design thinking, engineering precision, and user-centered methodologies. Whether it’s building a scalable design system, prototyping an interactive interface, or solving complex design challenges, I approach each project with curiosity, a commitment to excellence, and a focus on delivering results.</p>
            <p>Beyond my technical skills, I’m driven by a desire to continuously learn and explore new ways to push the boundaries of what’s possible. Based in the vibrant city of Vienna, I’m inspired by the rich cultural heritage and innovative spirit that surrounds me. I’m always eager to connect with others who share a passion for design, technology, and making a positive impact through creative solutions.</p>
